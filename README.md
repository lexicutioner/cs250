How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

As stated in the question, the best way to interpret user needs is by creating user stories for each request made. Doing so helps when it comes to handing out tasks to developers, as well as gauging how much time and effort is necessary to complete it.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I think the best approach is always by making sure I have a firm grasp on what is required of me, and also ensuring i'm maintaining communication with other developers on what is going on.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means ensuring I am updating those around me and communicating ideas I may have. It also means being respectful of our joint working environments and taking feedback well.
